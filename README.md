2.short type overflow: n=256 the overflow can be detected by creating a method that would tell if the the sum became negative.

3.long type overflow: n=65536 the overflow can be detected by creating a method that would tell if the the sum became negative.

4.float type overflow: there is no set point where the sum overflows, once the "overflow" point is reached the output is inf at n=35.

5.double type overflow: there is no set point where the sum overflows, once the "overflow" point is reached the output is inf at n=171.

6.As 1/n would continue to grow, the input would become so large before a set "n" overflow value would be found.

7. The numeric error occurs because floats store number differently and therefore it alters the way the loop iterates.

8. Changing the variable i to a double allows the loop to iterate correctly.
